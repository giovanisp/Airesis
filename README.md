The first web application for eDemocracy OpenSource

Summary
--------
This innovative tool for participatory democracy put at the center, as the main actor, the citizen and finally allows them to be active in the decisions of their territory .

Users can view their own territory and listen to the voices and messages that come directly from other citizens or groups present.

The groups will be able to get in touch with the citizens, support the proposals and create events in the area.

Everything fully integrated with all major social networks and the ability to communicate through e-mail the proposals.

Users who wish to participate in the activities of groups can also sign up and follow the discussions on the forums.

But what really makes Airesis a platform for edemocracy?
The first thing is a totally innovative mechanism for the construction of proposals, where finally the contributions and the minds of the users will be able to merge and make it possible to write proposals in a shared way .

Airesis allows users to have a better ranking on the basis of how they work and contribute to the proposals but at the same time allows a true comparison on the topics and content while maintaining the anonymity of users during the construction of the proposals.

Each time a user participates in a proposal will be overshadowed his real name, so as to ensure that the discussions will focus on the texts and the value of what is written rather than who wrote it.

A system for evaluating the contributions and proposals totally new will automatically identify the users who write better and those who write worse by allowing them to write and evaluate better within the system.

Finally, an implementation of the method schulze will always hold genuine elections within groups or to choose the best among the proposals.

Absolutely simple and intuitive interface will allow everyone in a short time, to find all the information they want.

What else should I know? What are we working on right now?

We are working hard trying to convert Airesis in a modular Engine.

We want to take out everything which is related to our installation and make it more easy to install.

We are working mainly on the proposals and the layout.
